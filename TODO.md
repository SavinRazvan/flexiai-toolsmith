**NOTES**

> In `chat.js`, some bugs still require fixing (backend works correctly in Quart, but frontend edge cases exist from form/video experiments)
> 
> The pure HTML (tag) approach might be cleaner - give it a shot and share your results
> 
> **Looking ahead:** WebGL+AI could shape the next web standards. Frontend folks - this is where things are heading.
